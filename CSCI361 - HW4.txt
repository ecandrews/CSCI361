1.
AMAT = hit time + miss rate * miss penalty
cycle time = 3 ns
AMAT = 3 ns + (0.10 misses / instr * (30 clock cycles * 3 ns))
AMAT = 3 ns + 9 ns = 12 ns

2.
Single association
	
3.
inst miss cycles = miss rate * miss penalty
inst miss cycles = .011 * 100 = 1.1 cycles
data miss cycles = miss rate * miss penalty * instr frequency
data miss cycles = .03 * 100 * .3 = 0.9
total miss cycles = 1.1 + 0.9 = 2.0
CPI speed with stalls = 2 + 2.0 = 4.0
So a processor with a perfect cache and zero misses would run twice as fast as a processor with these misses.

a.
MTBF = MTTF + MTTR
MTBF = 300 days + 2 days = 302 days

b.
Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
Availability = 0.993

c.
As MTTR approaches zero, the availability gets closer and closer to 1, or 100%.

d.
As MTTR gets bigger, the availability will get smaller and smaller and eventually approach zero.

5.
Yes, there is an error in parity bit p8.
The corrected value is: 0011 0110 0101
